The Yeezy 350 Linen v2 looks to be a design evolved from the previously released 'Antlia' colourway that dropped in 2019. Painted in a clean beige hue which most peoples colour palette would acknowledge as being more yellowish than anything. Across the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Linen's iconic upper, a mesh stripe shoots across the lateral side panels. A now traditional motif signature on all the more recent additions to the Yeezy 350 portfolio. Accompanying this again, a brand standard set of fit laces offer the only purely functional feature on the design. Contrasting the subtle beige/yellow hue that imprints the Yeezy Linen's upper and midsole, in injections of baby blue that are presented on the sockliner and aforementioned mesh stripe. While further complement is paid to the design via a rose pink outsole that lines the bottom of the patented Adidas Boost unit.
